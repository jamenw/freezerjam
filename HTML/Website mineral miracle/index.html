<tr><td class="info-header">How best to use Mineral Miracle?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="info-inside"><br><b>Plants including Tomatoes, Strawberries, Roses & Flowers - </b> <br><br><b>
  • Method One:</b> Simply apply 1/2 to 1 tablespoon (scoop included) around each plant every 1 to 4 weeks depending how depleted the soil is and condition of the plant.  This method works best with loose soils.  Rake and water into soil.  
  <br><br>
  <b>
   • Method Two: </b>Apply 1/4 cup around each plant when planting.  This method may work better with dense soils.  Rake and water into soil.  
  <br><br>
  <b>Shrubs including Raspberries & Grapes - </b> Apply 1 cup in the spring and in the fall.  Add more for larger shrubs. Rake and water into soil.
  <br><br>
  <b>Trees - </b> Apply 2 to 4 cups in the spring and in the fall.  Add more for larger trees.  Rake and water into soil.
  <b><br><br>Other Fertilizers -</b> Compost, humus, manures, or other fertilizers should be added to provide the needed nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

<tr><td class="info-header">Is Mineral Miracle harmful to plants?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="info-inside"><br>Mineral Miracle will not harm or burn plants and is completely safe to use with other fertilizers.  <br><br>
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="info-header">Where does Mineral Miracle come from?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="info-inside"><br>It is estimated that a volcanic ash was deposited about 30 million years ago that formed a seabed plentiful of trace minerals.  Today we have been able to pelletize the minerals.  The process begins with mining the minerals and grinding them up in a powder form that are then mixed in a solution to pelletize. <br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td class="info-header">Can Mineral Miracle be used on Cannabis?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="info-inside"><br>The answer is yes.  <br>Cannabis really thrives with these minerals. <br>See below directions.  <br><br>
  <b><u>These are the benefits specific to Cannabis</u></b><br>
  • Faster Growth – by up to 20%<br>
  • Stimulates thicker buds<br>
  • Produces more trichomes<br>
  • Increases THC<br><br>
 <b><u> Cannabis Directions</u></b><br>
<b>Soil - </b> Apply 1 tablespoon (scoop included) around each plant twice a week and water in. 
<br>Look for results in as little as 2 weeks. 
<br><br>
<b>Hydroponic - </b> Apply a tablespoon (scoop included) for each plant twice a week into the reservoir and allow time to dissolve.  Most reservoirs have a circulation pump so for best results circulate Mineral Miracle for 10 minutes prior to feeding plants.  Look for results in as little as 2 weeks. <br><br>
<b>Other Fertilizers -</b> It is recommended to continue to use your favorite N/P/K fertilizer along with Mineral Miracle. <br><br></td></tr>
